Here's how it works:\n\nDynamic Point Adjustments: Points gained or lost depend on the difference in ranking between opponents. Beating a higher-ranked opponent yields more points than beating a lower-ranked one.\n\nBalanced Outcomes: Wins, losses, and draws all affect rankings differently, ensuring a balanced and fair progression.\n\nNew Player Boost: New players receive a temporary multiplier on their point changes, allowing them to reach their appropriate skill level faster.\n\nGradual Progression: The system is designed so that consistent performance over time is required to significantly change your ranking.\n\nSelf-Correcting: If a player is incorrectly ranked, the system allows for quicker adjustments through matches against higher or lower-ranked opponents.",
